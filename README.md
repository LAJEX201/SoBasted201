<!-- ====================================== -->

<!-- FYI about resent.css: we had added the reset css but forgot to actaully fill in the document. Had completed our CSS and realized reset was empty/blank. We populated reset with a standard reset from online and it messed up our css. So we intentionally chose to omit the reset.css because it was too late to add it in and fix the CSS changes it would have caused. -->
